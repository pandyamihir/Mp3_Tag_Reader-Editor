# Mp3_Tag_Reader-Editor
MP3 Tag Reader is a lightweight C command-line tool that extracts and displays ID3v1/ID3v2 metadata from MP3 files. It reads artist, title, album and other tag info, helping users organize music collections. Built using file I/O and binary parsing, it demonstrates low-level C programming.
